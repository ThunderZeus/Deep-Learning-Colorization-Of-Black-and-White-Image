# Deep-Learning-Colorization-Of-Black-and-White-Image

### Colorizing Old B&W Photos with Deep Learning

With this Machine Learning Project, we will be building a b&w image colorization system. The system can be used by designers and artists to design the b&w image within seconds. It can also be used by those people who want to color a b&w image but can’t afford an artist or they don’t know much about photoshop. As the name suggests itself that this system will automatically color old black & white images.

Since we are using a pre-trained model in this project, we don’t need any dataset. All we need is the pre-trained model. We have provided the model.
